Hello!

This program is capable of calculating your average grades. This program is not full proof but it is useful when trying to keep 
your calculations cleaner. For example:

If you have the categories and weight of a section such as:

Quizzes - 24.26 / 25
Exams - 23 / 35

You can enter both 24.26 and 23 and apply the divisor 60 (25 + 35) when you are prompted to do so.

How it works:

In order to compile this program use:

	make

When you are ready to calculate your grade use the command:

	./grades

This will start the program and begin prompting the user.
